Hello! I’m Aaron Exline, in high school I began my journey with Computer Science by learning HTML and CSS in a Web Design course. I also took a course in programming where I learned Python. Both classes became a foundation in me learning AP Computer Science with Java.
 
Currently, I’m a junior at University of Illinois Chicago pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I am proficient in Python, Java, C, C++ and have experience with HTML, SQL, JavaScript, CSS. In my time at UIC, I have worked on a unity game with a team of engineers as well as done research and worked on a Sign Language interpreter using OpenCV and media pipeline APIs in the ACM. I’ve also developed a cross communication game using Arduino R4 microcontrollers and researched April Tags API in correlation with robotics and OpenCV inside of the EDT. In addition to my CS work, I am also skilled in Sales, Product Management, Working in Fast Paced Environments, and Customer Service as shown through my work as a trainer at White Castle.

Languages: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, C, SQL
